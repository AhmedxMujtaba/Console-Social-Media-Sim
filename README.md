# Social Media Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Social Media Application! This application allows users to interact with each other by posting messages, adding friends, and viewing posts from their friends.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can log in with their email and password or sign up for a new account.
- **Post Creation:** Users can create posts with titles and content, which are then displayed on their profile.
- **Friend Management:** Users can add and remove friends, view posts from their friends, and interact with their friends' posts.
- **Profile Management:** Users can change their name and password, delete posts, and view their own profile information.

## Technologies Used

- **C++ Programming Language:** The application is built using C++ for its robustness and performance.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** OOP principles are employed to organize the code into classes and objects for better modularity and maintainability.
- **Singleton Pattern:** The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that only one instance of the UserData class exists throughout the application.
- **Data Structures:** Various data structures such as queues, stacks, and vectors are used to store and manage user data, posts, and friends.
